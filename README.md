# Easy Shop
### Description
``
Hello ladies and gents, this is my 3rd capstone project for Year Up where I had to help fix a website. 
In this capstone I had to get a bit more familiar with Spring Boot to help me navigate through this project and fix 
whatever errors were occuring.``

### Issues
`` There were some issues that I admittedly ran into throughout the project. Like I said, I had to get familiar with
Spring Boot, so it wasn't easy at first when I was first learning it. I messed up for a while in the beginning when I had
to adjust the @PathVariable since at first I didn't quite understand how the Path Variable got information from the
URL so I had to rewatch our class lessons to fully understand that part.``

### Special Thanks to:
- Raymond Maroun for helping me with my Java journey
- Hamza and Christian for helping understand concepts I couldn't fully grasp in class
- Google for always being there whenever I needed it
